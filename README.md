This game opens up several new possibilities of playing a simple platformer. The aim of the game is to complete the platformer while looking
at the map as little as possible. The scoring works like golf, wherein you are given a par score (numberof times you can look at map) and 
correct score is calculated based on perfomance with respect to the par score. The story of the game is itself a branching storyline where 
the path at every branch is picked based on current state of the probability meter (probability meter shifts from alive to dead as you 
achieve more than par scores).
